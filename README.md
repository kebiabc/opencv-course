such as displaying its dimensions, draw on it, rotate, translate etc.

TASK2

We will be continuing on the project started on our first meeting, but we will add to our application
the functions we saw here.
For blurring, only gaussian!
Only adaptive thresholding!
For image gradients, show only the Gx, Gy and the result of them combined (like on the example)
The rest is OK!
