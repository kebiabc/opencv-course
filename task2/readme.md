TASK2

We will be continuing on the project started on our first meeting, but we will add to our application the functions we saw here. For blurring, only gaussian! Only adaptive thresholding! For image gradients, show only the Gx, Gy and the result of them combined (like on the example) The rest is OK!

To start, enter the relative path of the image on the command line.Then implement corresponding operations through buttons, just like Task1.
